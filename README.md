# Todo's list in React

This is my first application which I wrote during an online programming school at YouCode Academy. There is a large community of students who helped each other every day.
It was the initial application that I coded from the beginning and learning step by step basics of vanilla JavaScript language. Then the application was rewritten into React. This experience showed me how looks rendering elements on page and how many things you need to remember when you not using React.

## Used technologies:

- create-react-app
- webpack
- Normalize.css
- Styled Components
- JSX
- JS ES6+
- React
- React Router
- React Redux
- Redux Toolkit
- localStorage

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
